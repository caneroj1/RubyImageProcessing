I am working on making an image processing library for Ruby. Right now I am able to apply a Sobel filter to pick out horizontal and vertical lines in an image. I will add more to this soon. The code also needs to be cleaned up.

I learned a little about Computer Vision in my Human-Computer Interaction class at TCNJ, which is where I learned about the Sobel filter.
